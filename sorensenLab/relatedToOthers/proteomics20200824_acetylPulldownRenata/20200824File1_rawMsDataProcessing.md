# Processing MS raw data <!-- omit in toc -->

This document goes through the processing used on the raw data for the acetyl pulldown samples.

## System and software information

These data were processed on a standard computer using MaxQuant (version 1.6.10.43). The database used can be found in the repository location for this project. All parameters were set with default settings, adding in Acetyl(K) as a variable modification. LFQ and match between runs were active using the default settings.
