# PRD lysis conditions <!-- omit in toc -->

This document describes the experiments related to figuring out how best to do lysis for SP3 PRD.

**Goal:** Determine how we can get effective lysis of cell material (ideally with a protocol that is amenable to tissues as well) as a first step of the PRD protocol.

## Experiment design

The main challenge here is that we will have to combat chromatin that is released upon lysis. For really small cell numbers this won't really be an issue, but for larger ones it absolutely will be. I am thinking we can revisit the SP3-disruption protocol here to see how well this would work. Ideally, we want to demonstrate this with a vortex. We know it works with a FastPrep, but not everyone has access to this.

Want to analyze a set of 4 samples:

* 1X lysate, no disruption
* 1X lysate, bead disruption on vortex
* 2X lysate, no disruption
* 2X lysate, bead disruption on vortex

All samples here will be processed in a volume of 100uL in 2mL tubes. To measure if it is sufficient, we will simply perform SP3 on the samples and visually assess chromatin breakdown or the amount of clumping we observe. For a lysate, a fresh cell pellet will be equally aliquoted to the 4 samples (in 1X or 2X format based on the specific sample). The lysis buffer should contain SDS to ensure nuclei lysis and to visualize the impact of foaming. Based on the result here and of the digestion times, we will proceed with a PRD sample using the optimized parameters.
