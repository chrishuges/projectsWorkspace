# Sanger sequencing of piggyBac vectors

This document is just for record keeping of primers I designed for Sanger sequencing of the piggyBAC vectors I have assembled.

## Design

All of the primers were designed using the NCBI primer design tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). Generally, a Sanger run seems to yield around 1,000bp of sequence information. Since all of the vectors have different inserts, I designed a vector upstream to the EFS promoter (forward) and one downstream of the stop codon for the ORF (reverse). I will use these individually in Sanger to verify the inserts from either end.
